LOTTO GAME.

# Lotto fake extraction

Reproduction of the classic Lotto game.

The program asks the user to specify the number of lotto game extractions they want to generate. The user can specify a number between 1 and 5, or use 0 to exit the program.

Afterwards, the user is asked how many euros they want to bet on each combination (e.g. two numbers, three numbers, etc.):


                        +-------------------------------+----------+
                             Lotto             | Ticket 1 |
                        +-------------------------------+----------+
                        | terno on bari                            
                          |[28, 37, 73]                 3.0â‚¬
